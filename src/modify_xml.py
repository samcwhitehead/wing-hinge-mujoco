"""
A set of functions that can be used to automatically add stuff to the Mujoco
model xml files that are returned from Blender.

Seems especially useful because the Blender GUI makes it very easy to
overwrite xml files with manual edits in them

Examples of things to include:
    - add/remove contacts
    - add actuation
    - ...
